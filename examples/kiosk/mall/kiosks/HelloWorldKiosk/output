Feature: Basic Kiosk Resource Operations
  In order to test and validate the basic operations of a resource in a kiosk
  As a kiosk client developer
  I want to be able to call a kiosk and get responses
  
  Note: Kiosk resource service calls always return a JSON map.
    Any exceptions thrown come from the infrastructure not working properly.

  Background: 
    Given the kiosk found at 'http://localhost:9901/Toolshed'
    And the resource 'HelloWorldKiosk' in the kiosk

  Scenario: Basic List Call
>>> url: http://10.0.2.15:9901/Toolshed/HelloWorldKiosk
    When the resource's list method is called
    Then the results include 'greeting' with value 'Hello World'

  Scenario: Error List Call
>>> url: http://10.0.2.15:9901/Toolshed/HelloWorldKiosk?data=%7B%22attempt%22%3A%22fail%22%7D
    When the resource's list method is called with input '{"attempt": "fail"}'
    Then the results include '_ERROR_' with value 'TEST ERROR'

  Scenario: Basic Read Call
    When the resource's read resource '4' method is called
    Then the results include 'greeting' with value 'Hello Reader 4'

  Scenario: Basic Create Call
    When the resource's create method is called with input '{"box": "Top"}'
    Then the results include 'greeting' with value 'Hello Top'
      expected: "Hello Top"
           got: nil (using ==) (RSpec::Expectations::ExpectationNotMetError)
      ./features/step_definitions/kiosk_steps.rb:60:in `/^the results include '(.*?)' with value '(.*?)'$/'
      features/basic-remote.feature:27:in `Then the results include 'greeting' with value 'Hello Top''

  Scenario: Basic Update Call
    When the resource's update resource '4' method is called with input '{"box": "Lambs"}'
    Then the results include 'greeting' with value 'Hello Lambs'

  Scenario: Basic Delete Call
    When the resource's delete resource '6' method is called
    Then the results include 'status' with value 'ok'
